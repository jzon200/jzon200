### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio as a Full Stack Web Developer! I am dedicated to building dynamic and functional web applications that meet the needs of both users and clients. Here, you will find a showcase of my projects, ranging from simple static websites to complex, data-driven web applications.

I primarily work with a Meta Framework called Next.js and combines it with front-end technologies such as React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, Firebase, and Prisma. I am constantly seeking to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices.

Feel free to take a look around and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub!
